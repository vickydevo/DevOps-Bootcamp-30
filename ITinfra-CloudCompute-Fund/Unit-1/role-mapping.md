This is a **performance-based activity**. Your job as the instructor is to **facilitate** the session, while the **students perform** the actual work.

Think of yourself as a "Career Coach" for this hour. You aren't just lecturing; you are guiding them through a discovery process.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how you should run this workshop:

---

### Step 1: The Self-Assessment (20 Minutes)

**What to do:** Give students a way to look inward. You can provide a printed worksheet or ask them to draw four columns on a piece of paper:

* **Skills:** What am I good at? (e.g., Coding, troubleshooting, talking to people, organizing data).
* **Interests:** What do I actually enjoy? (e.g., Solving puzzles, building things from scratch, finding security holes, making things run faster).
* **Work Style:** Do I like being "on-call" for emergencies, or do I prefer long-term planning?
* **Values:** Is high pay most important, or "saving the day" during a cyber-attack?

### Step 2: The Role-Mapping (15 Minutes)

**What to do:** Now, help them "map" those self-reflections to the specific industry roles you mentioned (Operations, Security, Automation, Cloud).

| If they like... | Map them to... |
| --- | --- |
| Troubleshooting & keeping things running | **Operations (SRE / SysAdmin)** |
| Finding weaknesses & protecting data | **Security (Penetration Tester / SOC Analyst)** |
| Writing scripts to do boring tasks for them | **Automation (DevOps Engineer)** |
| Building massive, scalable systems | **Cloud (Cloud Architect / Engineer)** |

### Step 3: Discussion (25 Minutes)

**What to do:** This is the most interactive part. Ask "What attracts you?" and prompt them to defend their choice.

* *“Rahul, you said you like breaking things to see how they work. Why does that lead you to Security rather than Operations?”*
* *“Sneha, you enjoy writing Python but hate manual server setups. How does that fit into Automation?”*
