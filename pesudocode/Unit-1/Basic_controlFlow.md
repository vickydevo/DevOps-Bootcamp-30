# Unit 1: Pseudocode Basics & Control Flow

**Course:** Pseudocode – Placement-Oriented Module
**Duration:** 4 Hours
**Mode:** Lecture + Guided Examples + Lab
**Learning Outcomes Covered:** LO1

---

## 🌱 Purpose of Unit 1 (Why This Unit Comes First)

Most students fail coding questions **not because they don’t know syntax**, but because:

* They don’t know how to **think step-by-step**
* They jump directly into code
* They can’t explain their logic clearly

👉 **Pseudocode removes syntax fear** and helps students think like interviewers expect.

This unit:

* Standardizes **one simple pseudocode style**
* Teaches **how to think before coding**
* Introduces **dry-run (manual execution)**

---

## 🎯 Unit 1 Objectives

By the end of this unit, students will be able to:

* Understand what pseudocode is and why companies use it
* Write simple step-by-step logic using pseudocode
* Use IF–ELSE and loops without syntax fear
* Dry-run pseudocode to verify correctness
* Read and understand basic algorithm logic

## 📘 1.1 What is Pseudocode? (1 Hour)

### What is Pseudocode? (Very Simple Meaning)

Pseudocode is:

> **Writing the solution steps in simple English, but in a structured way**

It is:

* Not programming language
* Not English paragraph
* Somewhere in between

💡 Think of it like:

* Writing cooking steps before cooking
* Writing exam steps before solving maths

---

### Why Do Companies Care About Pseudocode?

In interviews:

* Companies test **logic**
* Not syntax
* Not memorization

Interviewers want to see:

* Can you think clearly?
* Can you explain your approach?

👉 Pseudocode shows **clarity of thinking**

---

### Pseudocode Style Used in This Course

To avoid confusion, **one standard style** is used:

* `INPUT`
* `OUTPUT`
* `IF / ELSE`
* `FOR / WHILE`
* `FUNCTION`
* Proper indentation

Example:

```
INPUT number
IF number > 0
    OUTPUT "Positive"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Not Positive"
END IF
```

👉 Simple, readable, interview-friendly

## 📘 1.2 Control Flow Basics (1 Hour)

Control flow means:

> **The order in which instructions are executed**

There are **three basic control flows**.

---

### 1️⃣ Sequence (Step-by-Step Execution)

Sequence means:

* Instructions run one after another

Example:

```
INPUT a
INPUT b
sum = a + b
OUTPUT sum
```

👉 Like following steps in a recipe

---

### 2️⃣ Selection (Decision Making – IF / ELSE)

Selection means:

* Making decisions based on conditions

Example:

```
INPUT marks
IF marks >= 40
    OUTPUT "Pass"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Fail"
END IF
```

👉 Like deciding:

* If it rains → take umbrella
* Else → don’t take umbrella

---

### 3️⃣ Repetition (Loops – FOR / WHILE)

Loops mean:

* Repeat steps multiple times

Example:

```
FOR i FROM 1 TO 5
    OUTPUT i
END FOR
```

👉 Like doing 10 push-ups (repeat same action)
