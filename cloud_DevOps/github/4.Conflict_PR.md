## Understanding Git Conflicts

A **conflict** in Git occurs when changes from different branches cannot be merged automatically. This usually happens when two branches modify the same line in a file or when one branch deletes a file that another branch modifies.

### Example: Conflict Between Two Branches

Suppose you have a file `greeting.txt` with the following content:

```txt
Hello, world!
```

#### 1. Create Two Branches

```bash
git checkout -b branch-A
```
Edit `greeting.txt`:
```txt
Hello, world!
Welcome from branch A.
```
Commit the change:
```bash
git add greeting.txt
git commit -m "Update greeting from branch A"
```

Switch to another branch:
```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b branch-B
```
Edit `greeting.txt`:
```txt
Hello, world!
Welcome from branch B.
```
Commit the change:
```bash
git add greeting.txt
git commit -m "Update greeting from branch B"
```

#### 2. Merge and Cause a Conflict

Try to merge `branch-A` into `branch-B`:
```bash
git checkout branch-A
git merge branch-B
```
Git will report a conflict in `greeting.txt` because both branches changed the same line.

### Visualizing and Resolving Conflicts in VS Code

1. Open the project in **VS Code**.
2. The conflicted file (`greeting.txt`) will be highlighted.
3. Open the file to see conflict markers:

4. Use the VS Code interface to choose:
    - **Accept Current Change** (branch-B)
    - **Accept Incoming Change** (branch-A)
    - **Accept Both Changes**
    - Or manually edit and remove the conflict markers.

5. After resolving, stage and commit:

    ```bash
    git add greeting.txt
    git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in greeting.txt"
    ```

**Tip:** Always pull the latest changes and communicate with your team to minimize conflicts.
## Creating and Merging Pull Requests on GitHub  

### Understanding Pull Requests  
A pull request (PR) allows you to propose changes to a repository. It is used to suggest new code, fix bugs, or improve the existing codebase.  


## 🛡️ Phase 1: Admin Setup (Rulesets)
Instead of legacy branch protection, we use **Rulesets** for more granular control.

1. Go to **Settings > Rules > Rulesets**.
2. Click **New ruleset > New branch ruleset**.
3. Set Name to `Production Standards` and Status to **Active**.
4. Under **Target branches**, select **Add target > Include default branch**.
5. Under **Branch rules**, enable:
   * ✅ **Require a pull request before merging** (Set required approvals to `1`).
   * ✅ **Require status checks to pass** (If using CI/CD).

---

## 👥 Phase 2: Onboarding Collaborators
1. **Invite:** Admin goes to **Settings > Collaborators > Add people** and invites the user.
2. **Accept:** The new collaborator **must** check their email or GitHub notifications and click **Accept Invitation**.
   > ⚠️ *Note: You cannot push code until the invitation is accepted!*

---

## 🛠️ Phase 3: The Developer Workflow
All contributors must follow the **Feature Branch** pattern.

### 1. Setup & Sync
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Owner/repo-name.git](https://github.com/Owner/repo-name.git)
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

```

### 2. Work & Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: describe your change"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

```

---

## 🔍 Phase 4: PR & Code Review

1. **Open PR:** On GitHub, click **Compare & pull request**.
2. **Request Review:** Select a team member from the **Reviewers** sidebar.
3. **The Review:** Reviewer clicks **Review changes > Approve**.
