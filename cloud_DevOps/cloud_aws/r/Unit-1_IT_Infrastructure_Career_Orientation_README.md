## 📘 1.1 What is IT Infrastructure? (1 Hour)

### Definition & Scope
IT Infrastructure refers to all the **technology components** required to run and manage enterprise applications:

- **Hardware:** Servers, laptops, data center machines  
- **Operating Systems:** Linux, Windows Server  
- **Networking:** Routers, switches, firewalls, IP addressing  
- **Storage:** Hard disks, SAN, NAS, Cloud storage  

> 💡 *Without infrastructure, software cannot run.*

### Traditional vs Cloud Infrastructure

| Traditional (On-Premise) | Cloud Infrastructure |
|----|----|
| Buy hardware upfront | Rent resources on-demand |
| Fixed capacity | Auto-scale up/down |
| High maintenance | Provider manages hardware |
| Slow provisioning (weeks) | Fast provisioning (minutes) |

**Example:**  
Earlier, companies purchased servers for peak load.  
Today, cloud allows scaling only when required → **cost-effective**.
